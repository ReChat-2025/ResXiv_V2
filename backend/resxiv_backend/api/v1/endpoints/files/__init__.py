File Management Endpoints - L6 Engineering Standards

Refactored router that delegates to specialized modules.
Follows Single Responsibility Principle and reduces code bloat from 757 to ~50 lines.

Original: 757 lines â†’ Split into focused modules:
- file_upload.py: File upload operations
- file_management.py: Basic CRUD operations
- file_storage.py: Storage management and analytics
- file_bulk_operations.py: Bulk operations
