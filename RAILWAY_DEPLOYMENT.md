# ResXiv V2 - Railway Deployment Guide (With Existing Data)

## ðŸ“Š Your Data Package Includes:
- **PostgreSQL**: 364KB of user accounts, projects, and research data
- **MongoDB**: 108KB of chat/conversation data (21 messages, 1 conversation)  
- **File Storage**: 288KB of static files and uploads
- **Demo PDFs**: Sample research papers for demonstration

## Quick Deployment (5 minutes)

### 1. Push Everything to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy ResXiv with production data"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your ResXiv repository
4. Railway will auto-detect both services

### 3. Add Database Services
In your Railway project dashboard:
1. Click "New Service" â†’ "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL" 
2. Click "New Service" â†’ "Database" â†’ "MongoDB"
3. Click "New Service" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Redis"

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

**Backend Service:**
```
SECRET_KEY=railway-demo-secret-key-for-investors
JWT_SECRET_KEY=railway-demo-jwt-secret-key
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
CORS_ORIGINS=https://${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}
DATABASE_URL=${{DATABASE_URL}}
MONGODB_URL=${{MONGODB_URL}}
REDIS_URL=${{REDIS_URL}}
```

**Frontend Service:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://backend-${{RAILWAY_PROJECT_NAME}}.up.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 5. Data Migration
âœ… **Automatic**: The `migrate_data.py` script runs during deployment and:
- Imports your 364KB PostgreSQL database
- Restores your 108KB MongoDB chat data  
- Sets up all file storage with your existing PDFs
- Creates the same user accounts and projects you have locally
